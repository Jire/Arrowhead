## Sources

Sources are native references that can be read from and written to through Arrowhead.

`Process` and `Module` are the two sources available.

## Acquiring a process

You can acquire a process using a name (executable file name):

```kotlin
val process = processByName("process.exe")!!
```

You can also acquire by process ID (PID):

```kotlin
val process123 = processByID(123)!!
```

## Acquiring a module

You can use `.modules` off a process for a map of the module name to the `Module`.

```kotlin
val module = process.modules["module.dll"]!!
```

## Reading from a source

You can use the implicit data type to read from an address:

```kotlin
val someByte: Byte = process[0x123]
val someInt: Int = process[0x123]
val someFloat: Float = process[0x123]
val someBoolean: Boolean = process[0x123]
```

The implicit type also works when passing arguments or using if expressions.

```kotlin
if (process[0x321]) // Boolean type inferred
    Math.sin(process[0x555]) // Double type inferred
```

Sometimes it's easier or necessary to use explicit types, and we have you covered:

```kotlin
val someByte = process.byte(0x123)
val someInt = process.int(0x123)
val someFloat = process.float(0x123)
val someBoolean = process.boolean(0x123)
```

## Writing to a source

Writing to a source is just as easy as reading.

You can use "implicit" writing with the set operator.

```kotlin
something[0x123] = 1.toByte()
something[0x123] = 1
something[0x123] = 1F
something[0x123] = true
```

There are no "explicit" writes, as the "implicit" writes are simply method overloads.

## Dealing with structs

Defining structures is [the same as in JNA](https://jna.java.net/nonav/javadoc/overview-summary.html#structures),
except you should extend `Struct` (of `org.jire.arrowhead`) instead of JNA's `Structure` (of `com.sun.jna`)
to take advantage of the reuse ("caching") system and other enhancements like automatic field order.

For JNA and Arrowhead to detect fields correctly, make sure to annotate them with
[`@JvmField`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.jvm/-jvm-field/).

The easiest way to get a struct is by referring to its class type and using the `get` extension function.

```kotlin
val struct = MyStruct::class.get()
```

If you have a constructor for your struct type, you can use the get operator to pass the arguments in:

```kotlin
val struct = MyStruct::class["abc", 1, 2, 3]
```

To read into a struct you can use its read function, which takes the address to read and the source to read from:

```kotlin
struct.read(address = 0x123, source = something)
```

To write the struct to a source you can use its write function, which is similar to reading:

```kotlin
struct.write(address = 0x123, source = something)
```

After you're done using a struct you should release it back into the caching pool:

```kotlin
struct.release()
```
